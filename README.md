# Shortest-path-in-a-3d-world

The problem is set in a 3d world. The shortest path from the start point to the end point has to be found using BFS, A* search and Uniform cost search methods. The input coordinates of the 3d world are stored in the form of a "trie" data structure for space efficiency. The trie data structure is implemented using series of nested python dictionaries. The edges are not predefined instead the agent who will be traversing the path has been given a set of actions(distance and the directions in which it can move) to perform at certain grid points. Thus a graph construction is also required. So, the algorithm is implemented in such a manner that the both the path finding algorithm and the graph construction are done in the same step for time efficiency.
